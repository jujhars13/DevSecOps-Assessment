16,observability,J,L,,,Observability,Service Status,How do we display the current service/system status to ops teams and business stakeholders,We build a dashboard in collaboration with the operations and business teams. UX is a key consideration,Operations teams tend to discover the status indicators themselves,,,1
18,deployments,J,L,A,,Deployments,CI/CD Speed and Stability,CI/CD processes are fast and stable,The CI/CD pipelines are super fast and we get feedback on our software on almost real-time basis,CI/CD takes so long to do or is very fragile and we end up losing big chunks of our day to it.,,,1
19,deployments,J,L,A,,Deployments,Blue-Green,Any mechanism to test a new version alongside an existing version when necessary,"We use fine-grained blue-green deployment techniques, at the level of individual services",We do not use any blue-green deployment techniques,,,1
20,deployments,,,,,Deployments,Idempotency - Redploying the app,What would happen if we decided to redeploy the application even though nothing has changed,No worries,"We don’t know what would happen, the deployments are flakey",,,1

22,deployments,J,L,,,Deployments,Fresh config,What would happen if we decided to delete the config and redeploy it,"No worries, the application would behave as it did before",It’s very likely the app would behave differently as there’s a lot of manual changes,,,1
23,deployments,J,L,,,Deployments,Automated config,Config should always be performed by an automated process using values from your configuration repository,All config is done using scripts,Many of our applications are configure manually each time,,,1
24,availability,J,,,,Availability,MTTR,How long does it take you to restore service in the case of an incident,We track our MTTR across the board and can restore in <10 mins on average,We measure repair in days and we do not track this properly,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_to_repair,,1
25,availability,J,L,,,Availability,Service KPIs,How do we track the main service/system Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)? What are the KPIs?,We use logging and/or time series metrics to emit service KPIs that are picked up by a dashboard,We do not have Service KPIs defined,,,1
26,availability,J,,,,Availability,Service Restoration,How do we keep things up and running: Can you recover quickly from incidents a low MTTR? Can you detect incidents ahead of time?
